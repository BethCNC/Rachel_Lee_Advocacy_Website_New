Here, we aren’t just navigating insurance paperwork or recommending the first doctor on our list. We LEARN you, and strive to guide you to people, answers and care you can trust.\nWe’ll start with a medical history and life history oriented around your needs and goals. We will listen to your story and help you feel seen and heard, so you can listen to your own body clearly and BELIEVE what you hear.\nThen, we will help guide you to people, answers, and care you can trust. But we don’t stope here. We will work with you before each new appointment to track symptoms, process possible outcomes and treatments, and prepare notes for you to take with you so you can REMEMBER what you want to say.\nNot only do we train for this, and study avidly to stay current on as many traditional, integrative and alternative options as we can we:\n\nBuild relationships with care providers in your area. \nSpend extra time and energy to listen to fellow patients about their experiences.\nAnd frequently have first hand experience of the conditions we specialize in. \n\nWhen you leave the doctor’s office feeling small, insignificant and confused, wishing you had remembered that one question or wondering if it is your fault that they can’t figure out what’s going on, Umi advocates are there to help you stand tall again. Or sit, or lay down! With pride and peace.\n\n\n\n\nCan you still help with paperwork?\nYes. We do everything else you have heard patient advocates do! But when we find you a physician we will vet them ahead of time concerning your condition and needs, study ways to best communicate with them as another unique individual in a complex process, help prepare you for the visit, and follow up after words to pursue your satisfaction and make sure your needs have actually been met.\nWhen we organize physician notes will pay close attention to errors, signs of possible misunderstanding, and even outright differences between your experience and that of the physician so you don’t have to spend a minute more than necessary with someone who isn’t truly listening to you. \nThe Umi Purpose\nWe do all this and SO much more within the freedom of our private membership association. Our advocates will create space for you to process your fears, anxiety, and concerns with thoughtfulness. They can also be a sounding board for your own process and creative ideas without consequences to your overall care.\nKnowing yourself and your body isn’t a privilege others should have while you are forced to observe from a distance. It is a gift to be loved, treasured and enjoyed. To be known by you.\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About:\nFAQs\nHow Umi Works\nOfferings\nCommunity Programs\nPatient Advocacy\nProviders\nStaff\nUmi Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\na private membership association\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquire about membership here.\n or\n\n\nApply Online\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *FirstLastContact NumberEmail *Comment or Message *Submit",

      "body_text": "Umi FAQs\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat conditions do you care for?  Many! We don’t care for conditions, we care for people and the body’s that call them home.  While we can inspire you with wellness coaching, fitness, nutrition and unique classes that grow and shape you inside and out, we are particularly known for our knowledge and ability to care for complex and multi system conditions that are most often misdiagnosed and misunderstood.  Conditions like Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, Fibromyalgia, or bizarre expression of sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis.\nMedical conditions like connective tissue disorders and fibromyalgia can have very mild expression, or advance suddenly and take the patient by surprise. If you are coming to us in one of these surprises our Navigator’s will connect you with an advocacy consultant as quickly as possible. If you are in-between knowing and not knowing, we are here for you right were you are and will help get you where you need to be.\n\nCan my family come too? Absolutely. Many challenges to our wellness are hereditary and we understand that one of the biggest fears of a parent is “What if my children or loved ones have this?” Bring your spouse, your partner, your caregivers. The space is for children, too (we’ll have ours there!), where they can meet with other kids with shared experiences, or a compassionate mentor to help them talk through what it means to have a chronic condition and still find joy in life. Our special family days will allow mamas and daddies to get care peacefully while children play and learn with one of our talented teachers and do art, breathe work, reading games, movement fun, gardening and so much more.\n\nI don’t think I have complex condition but I’m looking something different for my health and community. Can I join? Yes! We are passionate about sustaining health and being with you whether you are struggling in mind, body or spirit, or just need the kind of community where you can feel heard, respected and supported as a whole person. We believe in healing the disconnect between our bodies and sense of self that is so subconsciously perpetuated in modern medicine. That you must only observe yourself while others have the privilege of knowing and understanding you, and telling you what to do about it.\nUmi can be a place for you to BE, care for yourself and your family, friends, children or pets, and feel your best affordably and meaningfully.\n\n\n\nWhat about my anxiety? I have PTSD from how I’ve been treated by the medical community. You’re not alone. This is a safe place. Not only will you find a community full of kindred spirits working towards their own recovery, from medical trauma to physical, psychological trauma, and more, you will find Joy. We will be networking with wonderful Mental Health Providers to grow a group of counselors who know what you’re going through almost, or just as well as, you do.  We’re also setting up community trauma recovery programs where you can process your story through writing, art, movement or meditation and prayer, and begin to heal on your own gentle terms.\n\nMy medical care is a mess, papers everywhere, so much testing and lab work. I don’t know how to handle it all. I’m scared that if people knew all the things that I’ve been through that they’ll think I’m making this up! We’ve been there too. We’re partnering with Rachel Lee Patient Advocacy to train skilled patient advocates who know the nuances of your condition(s), and community Navigators who will be able to help organize your medical history, put together the big picture, and even come with you to appointments at the Center and help take notes, recall all the questions you want to ask, and then sit with you afterwards to process what needs to be done.\n\n\n\nWhat is a Private Membership Association (PMA)?  A PMA is a unique, unincorporated business model that allows for incredible creativity, free will and service for its members. It is completely in the private sphere and as such can be designed based on REAL NEEDS rather than beurocracy.  Think of Umi a bit like an exclusive club. But instead of charging you like a fancy club, we are using this special model to keep our costs lower than is possible with other business models, while raising the standard of care beyond excellence and into the realm of personal, unique neeeds of overlooked and marginalized communities. The PMA community is maintained by a trustee or trustees who are members, and services are provided by other members of that same community.\nWhen you join Umi, you affirm as a private individual, with inalienable rights protected by the Constitution and our legal advocacy team the following: 1. your right to chose your own medical care. 2. The right to choose your own treatment plan and modalities. 3. Your right to choose your own providers to meet these needs.\n\n\n\n\nWe chose the PMA model because it reflects our desire to create a community with real freedom. Not just for our providers to give skilled care and therapies affordably, but for our members to be able to truly be themselves. Second, it represents our desire to engage with the most difficult cases, not just easy ones for a quick buck.\n\n\n\nWhat does it cost? Our membership fee is small, and lasts a lifetime. No monthly or even annual fees that you do not choose. Our offerings are available as needed, or as a part of a variety of subscriptions that allow for discounted services throughout the entire center. You can choose a predesigned bundle, or work with a Navigator to create specialty subscriptions built around what you specifically need NOW that will allow you to get the care you need right away, and also have time to pay for it.  We will not be in network with insurance companies, but we will provide superbills for services your insurance covers, and support to help you learn to file with your insurance company. We never want cost to be the reason you can’t have the help you need. Visit our How Umi Works page for details on membership!\n\nI’m in a financial crisis from health, or caring for someone with many needs and we can’t afford anything right now. We want to help. Let us know what you are going through honestly and we will do everything we can to give you support to get better. Why? Because we believe in what we’re offering!  Let us help you get stable so that you can go back to work, or find a new job you can love that doesn’t compromise you’re health.  And if that isn’t enough, we are developing a special Umi Care Fund for the men, women, and children who need it most. For those who qualify for severe financial distress and below poverty income, you may apply for support from this fund and receive the services you need to help get out of crisis and improve you’re quality of life. For more details call us today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquire about membership here.\n OR\n\n\nApply Online\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *FirstLastContact NumberEmail *Comment or Message *Submit",

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual $75.00\nFamilies of 2 or more joining together – $60.00/person\nLow Income/Financial Distress – $45.00\n\n\n\n\n\n*The protections of a private membership association are legally sealed by the financial transaction of joining members. It provides hard evidence for any federal or state institutions that would seek to limit our activates or gather fees for our activities.\nIf you feel you are in our low income or financial crisis category, give details to your Navigator or Advocate, and our office staff will specifically contact you to help get approval for the lower membership fee rate.\nStep 3: Affirming Membership\nOnce we receive your signed contract as a .pdf or scanned copy, it will be reviewed by the office of the Director for a final affirming signature.\nCongratulations! You’re now a member of the Umi Family!!!\nLet’s get you settled in.\nMeeting with a Navigator\nWe are here to serve you. A Navigator or Advocate will call or set up an online appointment to learn more about your needs.\nVisit a New Member Class!\nThese classes are offered monthly through the school year. They provide an opportunity for the community to meet other members, talk with advocates, and learn about how we embody our Code of Conduct and community acronyms. Info here.\nHave questions?\nWe are here for you! Send us an inquiry below and one of our Navigators (staff trained to help guide you through the center from here forward) will reach out to talk with you.  They can meet over the phone, online, even in person.\n\nOur Mission: to Leap!\nL – Learn Continually\nE – Engage Relationally\nA – Attach with Joy\nP – Play!
